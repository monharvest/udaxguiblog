# Slug Generation for Blog Posts

This blog now includes automatic slug generation for all posts. Slugs are URL-friendly versions of post titles used for SEO and clean URLs.

## Features

- **Automatic Slug Generation**: New posts automatically get slugs generated from their titles
- **Unique Slugs**: If a slug already exists, a number is appended (e.g., `my-post-2`)
- **Slug Updates**: When editing posts, slugs are regenerated if the title changes
- **Migration Script**: Existing posts can be updated with slugs using the migration script

## Slug Utility Functions

Located in `app/utils/slug.js`:

- `generateSlug(text)` - Converts text to a basic slug
- `generateUniqueSlug(text, existingSlugs)` - Generates a unique slug avoiding duplicates
- `isValidSlug(slug)` - Validates if a string is a proper slug format

## How It Works

1. **New Posts**: When creating a new post, a slug is automatically generated from the title
2. **Editing Posts**: If you change the title, the slug gets updated to match
3. **Existing Posts**: Run the migration script to add slugs to posts created before this feature

## Migration Script

To add slugs to existing posts that don't have them:

```bash
node scripts/migrate-slugs.js
```

This script will:
- Fetch all existing posts
- Generate slugs for posts that don't have them
- Update the posts with their new slugs
- Ensure all slugs are unique

## Slug Format

Slugs are generated by:
- Converting to lowercase
- Replacing spaces and special characters with hyphens
- Removing invalid characters
- Ensuring uniqueness

Example: "Hello World! This is a Test" â†’ "hello-world-this-is-a-test"

## Future Enhancement

The slug system is ready for individual post URLs. When you're ready to implement separate post pages, the slugs will enable clean URLs like `/posts/my-post-title`.
